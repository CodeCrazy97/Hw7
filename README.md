This is the final project in Database Security and Administration course at Eastern Kentucky University, fall 2019. The Final_Project.sql script file will create tables, views, triggers, functions, VPDs, and users to satisfy the specifications of Homework 7 in CSC 544 (see the hw07.pdf file). 

To run the Final_Project.sql file successfully, you must follow the below instructions:
1. Download Final_Project.sql.
2. Modify all connect statements in the file so that they connect to the PDB you plan on using. (Do not, however, change the usernames/passwords or "as sysdba"  associated with each connect statement in the file.)
3. Start SQL*Plus.
4. Login "sys as sysdba" and set your container to the PDB you wish to use.
5. Run the script file from SQL*Plus.
6. When the script file has ran successfully, you will be logged in as sysdba. (There is a statement at the end of the SQL file that logs the sysdba back into the SQL*Plus instance.) 

After the script runs, accounts for staff members, instructors, and students will have been created so that you can test this project (check the end of the Final_Project.sql file to see login information).
